# Applied-Microeconometrics-Project

1. Empirically prove causality via rigorous econometric methods. I created a custom made script for doing this kind of study in R by working through datasets in well-cited papers from microeconomics.

- ordinary least squares: College Degree on Wage - Card (1995)
- randomized control trial: Effect of Remedial Teacher on Student Performance - Banerjee, Cole, Duflo, and Linden (1997)
- instrumental variable: Compulsory Education on Earnings - Angrist & Krueger (1991)
- regression discontinuity: Autonomy of Schools on Student Graduation - Clark (2004)
- difference in differences
- panel data

2. Replication of a recent study in *American Economic Review (AER)* journal

- Glitz, Albrecht and Erik Meyersson. 2020. "Industrial Espionage and Productivity." American Economic Review, 110(4):1055-1103.
- Impact of intellectual theft on productivity spillover
